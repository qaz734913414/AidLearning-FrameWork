# AidLearning-FrameWork
Aid Learning FrameWork is a Linux system running on Android phone for AI programming. It means that when it is installed, your Android phone owned a Linux system which can run AI program in it. Now we support Caffe, Tensorflow, Mxnet, ncnn, Keras, cv2, Git/SSH powerfully. 

Furthermore we provide an AI coding develop tool named Aid_code. It can provide you a visual AI programming experience by using Python from zero on our framework!

Now you have a complete linux with a GUI running on Android (Real linux running on the busybox and not virtul environment. So it is faster and almost real-time.) and can tap your AI code on it visually!
